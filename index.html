              It's unusual for an artist to be so multi-talented. Beyonce is a
              globally famous, acclaimed vocalist while also being an incredible
              dancer, actress and performer.

              Her concerts are well-known for their incredible spectacle - the
              sets, the choreography - and she sells out stadiums and arenas
              internationally. She has performed at presidential inaugurations
              and the Super Bowl. Beyonce has been at the peak of the music
              world for over 20 years and has always successfully reinvented
              herself, encompassing so many different genres like R&B, hip-hop,
              rock, country and blues. She has sold over 200 million records and
              is the most-awarded female artist of all time. You can call her
              Queen Bey!

                <p>
                  Nineteen years after the formation of the Empire, Luke
                  Skywalker is thrust into the struggle of the Rebel Alliance
                  when he meets Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has lived for years in
                  seclusion on the desert planet of Tatooine. Obi-Wan begins
                  Luke's Jedi training as Luke joins him on a daring mission to
                  rescue the beautiful Rebel leader Princess Leia from the
                  clutches of Darth Vader and the evil Empire.

                  This is a film about people being alienated - from other
                  people, from their location. It's sometimes surreal, sometimes
                  funny and very original.

                  After the destruction of the Death Star, Imperial forces
                  continue to pursue the Rebels. After the Rebellion's defeat on
                  the ice planet Hoth, Luke journeys to the planet Dagobah to
                  train with Jedi Master Yoda, who has lived in hiding since the
                  fall of the Republic. In an attempt to convert Luke to the
                  dark side, Darth Vader lures young Skywalker into a trap in
                  the Cloud City of Bespin.
