            <h2>Why Star Wars?</h2>
            <h3>Why is Star Wars so great?</h3>
            <p>
              Much of the success of the Star Wars franchise is due to its
              story. On the surface, the Star Wars story premise is that of the
              classic conflict of good versus evil. Within this core shell of a
              story; however, there are several interwoven themes and subplots.
            </p>
            <p>
              Why so many of us enjoy Star Wars isn't just from the story, it's
              from the experience you get from watching the movies. The Star
              Wars universe contains laser guns, spaceships, secret
              organizations that stretch back millennia and monsters that both
              frighten and entertain. It's also the memorable characters and
              heart-wrenching plots in each movie. if you're looking for
              something as inspirational as it is action-packed, then I'd
              recommend watching Star Wars!

                  After the destruction of the Death Star, Imperial forces
                  continue to pursue the Rebels. After the Rebellion's defeat on

                  train with Jedi Master Yoda, who has lived in hiding since the
                  fall of the Republic. In an attempt to convert Luke to the
                  dark side, Darth Vader lures young Skywalker into a trap in
                  the Cloud City of Bespin.

                <p>
                  This movie provides an accurate depiction of politics, a
                  dictatorship, romance, and how it all comes together to
                  support a hero's journey. It also shows Luke's training as a
                  Jedi.

                  Years after the Clone Wars, the noble Jedi Knights lead a
                  massive clone army into a galaxy-wide battle against the
                  Separatists. When the sinister Sith unveil a thousand-year-old

                <p>
                  From a duel between an old politician and a short green alien
                  to a massive droid attack on Chewbacca's home planet, there's
                  so much to experience in Revenge of the Sith that isn't found
                  in the other movies.
